   <h1>Creating a paper-based assessment</h1>
   <p style="border: 2px solid blue; margin: 10px; padding: 10px; font-style: italic;">
      The workshop's focus is on creating paper-based individualized examinations with isomorphic questions.
      Digital examinations are inherently insecure, whereas paper-based examinations offer a significantly higher level of security.
      The questions we author can still be exported to learning management systems or digital assessment platforms.
      For take-home assessments and practice exams, these digital formats can be convenient.
   </p>
   <p>
      Here is a set of steps to guide you through creating paper-based assessments.
      While there are a number of steps, most involve one-off preparation (such as installation) and creating examples.
   </p>
   <p>
      If you encounter an error or issue at any step, please stop and ask for help before moving on to the next step.

   <h1>One-off preparation</h1>
   <h2>Installing the .NET SDK</h2>

   <ol>
      <li>
         Download .NET SDK from Microsoft: <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0">https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0</a>.
         We will use version 8 (LTS: long-term support). Please pick the installer that supports your operating system and platform.
      </li>
      <li>
         Open a console window (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on MacOS, or bash on Linux), and type in the command: <code>dotnet --version</code>.
         If the .NET installation was successful, you will get a response such as <code>8.0.404</code> in the command line.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Installing the Dividni framework</h2>
   <p>
      The instructions below are for Windows. A similar process can be followed for MacOS and Linux. Please let us know if you need help.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         Download the current <a href="https://dividni.com">Dividni</a> framework:
         <a href="https://dividni.com/framework/Dividni-v24.11.12.zip">https://dividni.com/framework/Dividni-v24.11.12.zip</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
         Unzip the content into <code>C:\Dividni</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
         Add to your PATH the location where you unzipped Dividni. On Windows, this can be achieved by
         typing <span style="font-style: italic;">Advanced system settings</span> in the
         Windows search bar, clicking on "View Advanced system settings",
         clicking on "Environment Variables...", double-clicking on "Path", clicking "New", and typing in <code>C:\Dividni</code>.
         Click a series of <code>Ok</code> to exit
         all windows.
      </li>
      <li>
         Open a console window (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on MacOS, or bash on Linux), and type in the
         command: <code>dotnet C:\Dividni\McqTestGen.dll -version</code>.
         If the .NET installation was successful, you will get a response such as <code>McqTestGen version 24.11.12</code>
         in the command line.
      </li>
   </ol>

   <h1>Creating our first exam paper</h1>
   <p>
      An exam paper requires two components: (1) a cover page containing details of the exam as well as instructions for students, and (2) questions.
   </p>
   <p>
      We have provided a sample cover page and sample questions to get started before creating your own. Please download these
      from <a href="https://dividni.com/tutorial/samples.zip">https://dividni.com/tutorial/samples.zip</a>, and extract them to a suitable
      folder such as <code>C:\Users\John\samples</code>.
   </p>
   <p>
      Recall that we programmatically create several instances of the exam paper - in fact, as many instances as there are students.
      The cover page is an HTML document while each question is a C# document (C# program, that is). We don't need to worry about the
      details at this point.
   </p>
   <p>
      The tool <code>McqTestGen</code> (part of the Dividni framework) is used to generate multiple instances of an exam paper.
   </p>
   <p>
      The instructions below are for Windows. A similar process can be followed for MacOS and Linux. Please let us know if you need help.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         Open a console window (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on MacOS, or bash on Linux).
      </li>
      <li>
         Navigate to the directory where the samples are: for example, <code>cd C:\Users\John\samples</code>
      </li>
      <li id="mcqTestGen">
         Issue the command: <code>McqTestGen.exe -cover SampleCover.html -paperCount 2 ApplesAndOrangesQ.cs</code>
         The option <code>-cover</code> sets the cover page to the given page description in <code>SampleCover.html</code>, and
         the option <code>-paperCount</code> specifies that we are after two instances of the exam paper.
         A successful execution of the command will produce two files: <code>000000.html</code> and <code>000001.html</code> containing
         two exam scripts. Double-click these two files to open them in a browser, and examine the generated exam scripts.
         Note the differences between the questions in the two exam scripts and the version number included in each scripts. The last two digits in the version number are checksum digits,
         while the rest of the digits contain the actual version.
      </li>
      <li>
         Increase the <code>-paperCount</code> value (e.g., to 4) and examine the additional exam scripts generated.
      </li>
      <li>
         You can try adding the option <code>-startID</code> with a value, such as 42, to specify the starting version of the script.
      </li>
      <li>
         Use the following command to generate exam scripts with marked answers for proofing:
         <code>McqTestGen.exe -proof -cover SampleCover.html -paperCount 2 ApplesAndOrangesQ.cs</code> where we have
         added an extra option <code>-proof</code>. The correct answers will be marked with a *** prefix.
      </li>
      <li>
         In addition to the <code>.html</code> files, <code>McqTestGen</code>
         generates <code>.txt</code> files that contain the answer codes (which can later be used to auto-grade student responses).
         Open the answer files <code>000000.txt</code> and <code>000001.txt</code> to examine their content.
         The answer files
         have three tab-separated columns: the first value is the question number, the second is the answer code, and third is the
         mark associated with the question.
         The answer code works as follows: 1 is option A, 2 is option B, 4 is option C, 8 is option D, and 16 is option E.
         These <code>.txt</code> files are used during the grading process.
      </li>
   </ol>

   <h1>Creating a cover page</h1>
   <p>
      The cover page is authored in HTML. It uses start and end tags to format text and other content.
      The start and end tags should match, and are case-sensitive.
      The first level heading is called <code>h1</code> and the start and end tags for this are &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt; respectively.
      Therefore, we would specify a first level heading in HTML as <span>&lt;h1&gt;My First Level Heading&lt;/h1&gt;</span>.
      Similarly, a paragraph is <code>p</code> and the start and end tags for this are &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; respectively.
      A &lt;div&gt; groups several HTML elements (such as &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt;) together.
   </p>
   <p>
      The cover page contains a single &lt;div&gt; which in turn can contain other arbitray HTML elements. Examine the
      sample cover page <code>SampleCover.html</code> to see if that makes sense. You can try making content changes to
      this sample cover page. For instance, you may want change the university name to reflect your own university/institution,
      and also the course name to reflect something you teach.
   </p>
   <p>
      You cannot have an ampersand (&amp;) character in HTML: this has to be coded as <code>&amp;amp;</code>. Similarly,
      the less-than sign (&lt;) has to be coded as <code>&amp;lt;</code> and the greater-than sign (&gt;) has to be
      coded as <code>&amp;gt;</code>. Recall that the start and end tags should match, and are case-sensitive.
      Please keep these rules in mind as you make minor adjustments to the cover page.
   </p>
   <p>
      Major designs for exam cover pages are typically done one-off at the institution level, and proficient HTML coders can
      do this for us.
   </p>

   <h1>Creating a question</h1>
   <p>
      Proficient C# programmers can use C# to create questions. Most of us are not likely to be in this category.
      However, we have the means to create these C# questions online without having to program.
      <a href="https://dividni.online">Dividni.online</a> allows us to create such questions online.
      We will demonstrate how.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         Static answer banks. These are the easiest to create. We need to write the question, specify a set of
         correct answers (more the merrier), and specify a set of incorrect answers (again, more the merrier).
         We can preview the question (and all the answer options), and once we are happy we can download a C# version
         of the question to use with <code>McqTestGen</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
         Parametric variants. These are more complex and allow for dynamic variations in questions.
         We will demonstrate how we can create a couple of questions of this type.
      </li>
      <li>
         Create a few questions that are of value in a course you teach.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
      Once the question you created looks satisfactory, you can copy the C# code for
      the question to your local computer and use this with <code>McqTestGen</code> to create exam papers.
      See <a href="#mcqTestGen">point 3</a> of section <em>Creating our first exam paper</em>.
   </p>
   <h2>Slightly advanced topics</h2>
   <ol>
      <li>
         Including maths and formulae within questions or answers. This is done using LaTeX style inline equations.
      </li>
      <li>
         Including images. We can use the &lt;img&gt; tag in HTML to do this. We will need to host the image on a server, however.
         There are plenty of free servers (such as <code>imgur</code>) that allow us to host images, and we can make
         use of these if we don't have our own.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <hr />
   <h1>Conducting exams</h1>
   <p>
      To conduct exams, we need to print the HTML exam papers. We have scripts that can automatically convert 
      these HTML exam papers to PDF and merge them into a single PDF file for easy distribution and printing.
   </p>
   <p>
      Marking exams by hand, especially for a large class, is time-consuming and prone to errors. 
      Therefore, it is advisable to have students fill in their answers on OMR sheets, which can then be 
      graded automatically using <code>McqGrader</code>. The tool <code>OmrMaker</code> simplifies this process 
      by generating OMR sheets pre-filled with version numbers.
